# Lettuce-Growth-Analysis-Data-Driven-Insights-into-Agricultural-Optimization
ðŸ“„ ## Project Overview
This project explores how environmental conditions influence the growth of lettuce plants. Using data analytics and machine learning, it identifies the optimal conditions for growth phases, helping to enhance agricultural efficiency and sustainability. By modeling and visualizing factors like temperature, humidity, and soil quality, this analysis provides actionable insights for improving lettuce yields and reducing resource waste.

ðŸ“Š ## Dataset Description
The dataset contains observations on various environmental conditions and their impact on lettuce growth over time.

Features Included:
* Plant Identifier (Plant_ID): Unique ID for each plant
* Date: Date of observation
* Temperature (Â°C): Temperature in degrees Celsius
* Humidity (%): Humidity level in percentage
* Total Dissolved Solids (ppm): Parts per million of dissolved solids
* pH Level: pH measurement of the environment
* Growth Days: Days from initial growth to full maturity
